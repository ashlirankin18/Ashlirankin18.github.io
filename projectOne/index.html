  <p class="galleryParagraph">The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

  <figcaption class="galleryImageIndexCaption" ><em>Ice climbing & hiking on glaciers</em></figcaption>
  <p class="galleryParagraph">When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>
